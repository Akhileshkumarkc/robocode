WHAT IS ROBOCODE?\r\n\r\nRobocode is a programming game where the goal is to develop a robot\r\nbattle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET. The robot\r\nbattles are running in real-time and on-screen.\r\n\r\nThe motto of Robocode is: Build the best, destroy the rest!\r\n\r\nBesides being a programming game, Robocode is used for learning how to\r\nprogram, primarily in the Java language, but other languages like C# and\r\nScala are becoming popular as well.\r\n\r\nSchools and universities are using Robocode as part of teaching how to\r\nprogram, but also for studying artificial intelligence (AI). The concept\r\nof Robocode is easy to understand, and a fun way to learn how to\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nRobocode comes with its own installer, built-in robot editor and Java \r\ncompiler, and only pre-requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to exist on \r\nthe system where it must be installed. Hence, everything a robot \r\ndeveloper needs to get started is provided with the main Robocode \r\ndistribution file (`robocode-xxx-setup.jar`). Robocode also supports \r\ndeveloping robots using external IDEs like e.g. \r\n[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ \r\nIDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/), \r\n[Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vstudio/) etc., which \r\nsupports the developer much better than the robot editor in Robocode.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Robocode runs on the Java platform makes it possible to\r\nrun it on any operating system with Java pre-installed, meaning that it\r\nwill be able to run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, but also UNIX and\r\nvariants of UNIX. Note that Java 5.0 or newer must be installed on the\r\nsystem before Robocode is able to run. See the [System\r\nRequirements](#system-requirements) for more information.\r\n\r\nBe aware that many users of Robocode (aka Robocoders) find Robocode to\r\nbe very fun, but also very addictive. :-)\r\n\r\nRobocode comes free of charge and is being developed as a spare-time\r\nproject where no money is involved. The developers of Robocode are\r\ndeveloping on Robocode because they think it is fun, and because they\r\nimprove themselves as developers this way.\r\n\r\nRobocode is an Open Source project, which means that all sources are\r\nopen to everybody. In addition, Robocode is provided under the terms of\r\n[EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) (Eclipse Public\r\nLicense).\r\n\r\n### 2. HISTORY OF ROBOCODE\r\n\r\nThe Robocode game was originally started by Matthew A. Nelson, aka Mat\r\nNelson, as a personal endeavor in late 2000 and became a professional\r\none when he brought it to IBM, in the form of an AlphaWorks download, in\r\nJuly 2001.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2005, Robocode was brought to SourceForge as Open\r\nSource with Robocode version 1.0.7. At this point, the development of\r\nRobocode had somewhat stopped. In the meanwhile, the community around\r\nRobocode began to develop their own versions of Robocode in order to get\r\nrid of bugs and also to put new features into Robocode, the\r\nContributions for Open Source Robocode and later on the RobocodeNG\r\nproject by Flemming N. Larsen.\r\n\r\nAs nothing seemed to happen with Robocode in more than a year, Flemming\r\nN. Larsen took over the Robocode project at SourceForge as administrator\r\nand developer in July 2006. The RobocodeNG project was dropped, but the\r\nRobocode 2006 variant, which contained a lot of contributions from the\r\nRobocode community, was merged into the official Robocode with version\r\n1.1. Since then, lots of new versions of Robocode have been released\r\nwith more and more features and contributions from the community.\r\n\r\nRecently (from version 1.7.2.0), the .NET platform is supported through\r\na .NET plug-in provided by Pavel Savara based on\r\n[jni4net](http://jni4net.sourceforge.net/), also developed by Pavel\r\nSavara.\r\n\r\n### 3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIn order to run Robocode, Java 5.0 Standard Edition (SE) or a newer\r\nversion of Java must be installed on your system. Both the Java Runtime\r\nEnvironment (JRE) and the Java Developer Kit (JDK) can be used. Note\r\nthat the JRE does not include the standard Java compiler (javac), but\r\nthe JDK does. However, Robocode comes with a built-in compiler (ECJ).\r\nHence, it is sufficient running Robocode on the JRE.\r\n\r\nAlso note that it is important that these environment variables have\r\nbeen set up prior to running Robocode:\r\n\r\n-   `JAVA_HOME` must be setup to point at the home directory for Java\r\n    (JDK or JRE).  \r\n\tWindows example: `JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.5.0_22`  \r\n\tUNIX, Linux, Mac OS example: `JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.5.0_22`\r\n\r\n-   `PATH` must include the path to the `bin` of the Java home\r\n    directory (`JAVA_HOME`) that includes `java.exe` for starting the\r\n\tJava virtual Machine (JVM).  \r\n\tWindows example: `PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%`  \r\n\tUNIX, Linux, Mac OS example: `PATH=${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin`\r\n\r\nYou can read more details from here:\r\n\r\n-   [System Requirements](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/System_Requirements)\r\n\r\nIf you want to program robots in .NET or control Robocode from a .NET \r\napplication, you need to install the Robocode .NET API plug-in on top of \r\nRobocode. The plug-in is installed by double-clicking the \r\n`robocode.dotnet-xxx-setup.jar` the same way as Robocode itself is \r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n### 4. GETTING STARTED\r\n\r\nMost documentation about Robocode is provided thru the\r\n[RoboWiki](http://robowiki.net), which contains the official\r\ndocumentation about Robocode, but which also hosts the community around\r\nRobocode. It is highly recommended to read the articles on the RoboWiki\r\nfor getting started with Robocode. These articles are provided from\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n-   [Getting Started](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Getting_Started)\r\n\r\nYou should read about the anatomy of a robot, the game physics, scoring\r\netc.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about developing robots for .NET, these articles are a\r\ngood starting point:\r\n\r\n-   [Create a .NET robot with Visual Studio](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/.NET/Create_a_.NET_robot_with_Visual_Studio)\r\n-   [Debug a .NET robot with Visual Studio](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/.NET/Debug_a_.NET_robot_in_Visual_Studio)\r\n\r\n### 5. ROBOCODE API\r\n\r\nThe Robocode API is provided as HTML pages for both the Java and .NET\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\n-   [Java API](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/docs/robocode/)\r\n-   [.NET API](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/docs/robocode.dotnet/Index.html)\r\n-   [.NET Control API](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/docs/robocode.dotnet.control/Index.html)\r\n\r\nThe Robocode API actually consists of 3 different APIs.\r\n\r\n-   **Robot API**: Within the Java package `robocode` and .NET namespace\r\n    `Robocode`.  \r\n    The Robot API is used for developing robots, and is the only part of\r\n\tthe API that robots are allowed to access.\r\n\r\n-   **Robot Interfaces**: Within the Java package\r\n    `robocode.robotinterfaces` and .NET namespace\r\n\t`Robocode.RobotInterfaces`.  \r\n    The Robot Interfaces are used for developing new robot types with a\r\n    different API that the standard Robot API.  \r\n    ***Note:** The game rules and robot behaviors cannot be changed.*\r\n\r\n-   **Control API**: Within the Java package `robocode.control` and .NET \r\n    namespace `Robocode.Control`.  \r\n\tThe Control API is used for letting\tanother application start up\r\n\tbattles with selected robots in Robocode and retrieve the results.\r\n\tIt is also possible to get snapshots of robots and bullets (like\r\n\tposition, heading, energy level etc.) at a specific time in a battle.\r\n\r\n### 6. ROBOCODE REPOSITORY\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out new robots than the sample robots that come with\r\nRobocode, you should visit the [Robocode\r\nRepository](http://robocoderepository.com/).\r\n\r\nRobots are available under the\r\n[Bots](http://robocoderepository.com/Categories.jsp) section of the\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\nThe Robocode Repository is developed and maintained by David Lynn as a\r\nproject independently of the Robocode project.\r\n\r\n### 7. COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThe community around Robocode is using the RoboWiki as communication\r\nchannel. At the RoboWiki, people share new ideas, code snippets,\r\nalgorithms, strategies, and lots of other stuff about Robocode. New\r\nofficial documentation from the developers of Robocode will be put at\r\nthe RoboWiki as well.\r\n\r\nOn the RoboWiki, these strategies are provided:\r\n\r\n-   [Radar](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Radar)\r\n-   [Movement](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Category:Movement)\r\n-   [Targeting](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Category:Targeting)\r\n\r\nThe code snippets are also provided on the RoboWiki:\r\n\r\n-   [Code Snippets](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Category:Code_Snippets)\r\n\r\n### 8. CHALLENGES\r\n\r\nA good way to improve you self as a robot developer is to try out some\r\nreal challenges. On the RoboWiki, two famous challenges exist for\r\ntesting/studying a robots movement, targeting, and gun abilities:\r\n\r\n-   [Movement Challenge](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Movement_Challenge_(original))\r\n-   [Targeting Challenge](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Targeting_Challenge_(original))\r\n-   [RoboRumble Gun Challenge](hhttp://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble_Gun_Challenge)\r\n\r\n### 9. COMPETITION\r\n\r\nIf you want to challenge your robot(s) and yourself as robot developer,\r\nthe [RoboRumble@Home](http://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble) is the best\r\nway to do it. RoboRumble is the ultimate collaborative effort to have a\r\nlive, up-to-date ranking of Robocode bots. It uses the power of\r\navailable Robocoders' computers to distribute the effort of running\r\nbattles and building the rankings.\r\n\r\nRoboRumble is actually 3 different rumbles:\r\n\r\n-   **RoboRumble** (aka 1v1): One robot versus another robot - both\r\n    picked at random. These two robots a alone on the battle field.\r\n-   **MeleeRumble**: Ten robots picked at random all battle against\r\n    each other..\r\n-   **TeamRumble**: One team versus another team - both picked at\r\n    random. Each team consists of five or less robots.\r\n\r\nIn order to get started with RoboRumble, you should read this page:\r\n\r\n-   [Starting With RoboRumble](http://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble/Starting_With_RoboRumble)\r\n\r\nNote that the RoboRumble@Home client is built into Robocode and can\r\nbe started using the batch/shell/command files:\r\n\r\n                Windows           UNIX / Linux     Mac OS\r\n--------------- ----------------- ---------------- ---------------------\r\n**RoboRumble**  `roborumble.bat`  `roborumble.sh`  `roborumble.command`\r\n**MeleeRumble** `meleerumble.bat` `meleerumble.sh` `meleerumble.command`\r\n**TeamRumble**  `teamrumble.bat`  `teamrumble.sh`  `teamrumble.command`\r\n\r\nTwo other competitions exists which are:\r\n\r\n-   [Twin Duel](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Twin_Duel): Two teams\r\n    battle on an 800x800 field. Each team consists of two robots\r\n    (twins).\r\n-   [Hat League](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Hat_League): Two teams not\r\n    knowing each other are paired together at random (like drawing\r\n    names from a hat). Each team consists of two robots. These two\r\n\tteams must work together and defeat two other teams that have also\r\n\tbeen picked at random.\r\n\r\n### 10. COMMAND LINE\r\n\r\nIt is possible to specify options and predefined properties from the\r\ncommand-line when running Robocode. The usage of these can be listed by\r\nwriting this from a command prompt or shell:\r\n\r\n    robocode -help\r\n\r\nFor example, it is possible to:\r\n\r\n-   disable the graphical user interface (GUI).\r\n-   disable security that is specific to Robocode (but does not\r\n    override the security that comes with the JVM).\r\n-   enable/disable the debugging mode, useful when debugging robots.\r\n-   play a battle based on an existing Robocode .battle file.\r\n-   replay a recorded battle visually.\r\n-   save the results of battles in a comma-separated file.\r\n\r\nYou can read more details here:\r\n\r\n-   [Console Usage](http://robowiki.net/w/index.php?title=Robocode/Console_Usage)\r\n\r\n### 11. LINKS\r\n\r\nLinks relevant to Robocode are provided on the home page of Robocode:\r\n\r\n-   [Home Page of Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\r\nOther links are provided from the RoboWiki - especially for challenges\r\nand competitions:\r\n\r\n-   [RoboWiki](http://robowiki.net/)\r\n\r\nThe is also a Wikipedia page available about Robocode, which provides\r\ngood links to movement and targeting strategies, competitions, and other\r\nsites about Robocode:\r\n\r\n-   [Robocode on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocode)\r\n\r\n### 12. REPORTING DEFECTS\r\n\r\nIf you discover a defect (bug) in Robocode you are encouraged to report\r\nthe issue as soon as you discover it - the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nA bug report should be put on the [Bug\r\nTracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=37202&atid=419486&status=1)\r\non the SourceForge site for Robocode. Each bug report will be\r\nprioritized among other bug reports depending on its impact on the game.\r\n\r\nIt will be a great help if you describe how to see or which steps to do\r\nin order to reproduce the defect. You are very welcome to provide a\r\nscreen shot, source code or anything else that will show the bug. It is\r\nalso a very good idea to write which system and version of Robocode and\r\nJava you are using.\r\n\r\nIf you are a registered user at SourceForge (register\r\n[here](http://sourceforge.net/account/registration/)) you will be able\r\nto add a \"monitor\" on your bug report. This way you will be able to\r\nreceive notifications when someone add comments to your report, but will\r\nalso be able to better track the current status of the bug, e.g. when\r\nthe bug is fixed and with which version of Robocode the fix is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer yourself, and have a good idea of how the bug\r\ncould be fixed, you are more than welcome to do so. By fixing the bug,\r\nyou will become a contributor of Robocode yourself. You can learn more\r\nabout how to contribute [here](#how-to-contribute). Note that we accept\r\nbug fixes under the terms of\r\n[EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).\r\n\r\n### 13. FEATURE REQUESTS\r\n\r\nIf you got an idea for a new feature or improvement for Robocode, you\r\nare very welcome to share your idea by summiting a feature request.\r\n\r\nA feature request should be put on the [Feature Requests\r\nTracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=37202&atid=419489&status=1)\r\non the SourceForge site for Robocode. Each feature request will be\r\nprioritized among other feature requests.\r\n\r\nIt will be a great help if you describe your idea in detail, and how you\r\nthink it could be implemented into Robocode. For example, will it be\r\npossible to extend an existing feature with your idea?\r\n\r\nIf you are a registered user at SourceForge (register\r\n[here](http://sourceforge.net/account/registration/)) you will be able\r\nto add a \"monitor\" on your request. This way you will be able to receive\r\nnotifications when someone add comments to your request entry, but will\r\nalso be able to better track the current status of your entry, e.g. when\r\nthe feature has been implemented and with which version of Robocode it\r\nwill be available.\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer yourself, and have a good idea of how the feature\r\ncould be implemented, you are more than welcome to do so if the feature\r\nis being accepted. By implementing the feature, you will become a\r\ncontributor of Robocode yourself. You can learn more about how to\r\ncontribute [here](#how-to-contribute). Note that we accept\r\nimplementations under the terms of\r\n[EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).\r\n\r\n### 14. VERSIONS\r\n\r\nRobocode is continuously under development, and you should be aware that\r\nthree different release types exist for Robocode:\r\n\r\n-   **Alpha** version is an unofficial \"snapshot\" version of Robocode\r\n    that is under development and not feature complete yet. It is\r\n\tnormally provided for the person that has put a bug report or\r\n    feature request on the tracker for Robocode, which needs to be\r\n    verified. Alpha versions are not meant to be redistributed at all.\r\n\r\n-   **Beta** version is an official release that is considered feature\r\n    complete, and which intended for everybody to try out and test\r\n\tregarding all new features and changes, but which is also\r\n\tconsidered \"unstable\", and might contain some unwanted side-effects\r\n    due to the changes made to this version compared to the last final\r\n    version of Robocode. Defects or undesired behaviors should be\r\n    reported as soon as they are discovered so the issues can be fixed\r\n    before the final release. Everybody is encouraged to take part in\r\n    the testing Beta versions of Robocode.\r\n\r\n-   **Final** version is (as it says) the final version of a specific\r\n    and official release of Robocode, and where new features and bug\r\n\tfixes have been tested. Note, that the release will not state\r\n\t\"final\" on the distribution files for Robocode like it is the case\r\n\tfor Alpha and Beta versions.\r\n\r\n### 15. NEWS\r\n\r\nNews about Robocode is put on the blog spot for Robocode. Here it\r\nis possible subscribe to a RSS feed to receive news about Robocode.\r\n\r\n-   [Robocode News](http://robo-code.blogspot.com/)\r\n\r\nYou can also follow Robocode on Twitter and Facebook here:\r\n\r\n-   [Twitter for Robocode](http://twitter.com/robocode)\r\n-   [Robocode on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=129627130234)\r\n\r\nThe RoboWiki can be followed on Twitter as well:\r\n\r\n-   [Twitter for RoboRumble](http://twitter.com/robowiki)\r\n\r\n### 16. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to Robocode with e.g. a new feature or bug\r\nfix, you should read the [Developers Guide for building\r\nRobocode.](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Developers_Guide_for_building_Robocode)\r\n\r\nNote that we accept code changes under the terms of\r\n[EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).\r\n\r\nThere exist no or little documentation about the internals of Robocode, \r\nand the code base will need to be examined by a contributor in order to \r\nget an insight of how Robocode is implemented. Thus, it required a \r\nskilled Java developer to figure out how Robocode is put together. \r\n\r\nRobocode is divided into several modules. You can read Pavel Savara's\r\nblog to get a good overview of Robocode here:\r\n\r\n-   [Robocode modules](http://zamboch.blogspot.com/2009/06/robocode-modules-as-in-version-17.html)\r\n\r\nHelp for Robocode internals can be provided through the [Robocode\r\nDevelopers Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/robocode-developers)\r\nwhere you can register yourself, and start up a new topic. This is the best\r\nway of getting information and asking about details for the internals in\r\nRobocode.\r\n\r\nIf a contribution is a somewhat small change to involves under 10 files,\r\nthen the preferred way is to provide the contribution as a patch file\r\nthat can be applied to the existing Robocode sources. Otherwise, you can\r\nbe granted a Subversion branch for your work, where you can commit your\r\nchanges. Later, this branch needs to be merged into the trunk be the\r\nadministrators of Robocode and tested carefully. Additional work might\r\nbe done by other Robocode developers to finalize the work.","tagline":"Build the best - destroy the rest!","name":"Robocode","note":"Don't delete this file!
